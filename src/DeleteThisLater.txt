It works by running main in CGrep.java with program arguments of [pattern] [text file 1] [text file 2]...

Only the CGrep.java file is necessary.  We can either change the other files names or how they are arranged.

Change the names of variables.

Change the order of methods.

Change some of the logic (i.e. transform for loops into while loops)
